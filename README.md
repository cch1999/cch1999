### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the [Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine](www.ccaim.cam.ac.uk). My interests are in deep learning applied to solving problems in structural biology and drug design. I am supervised by Prof Sir Tom Blundell and Prof Pietro Lio.

- ðŸŒ± I was previously at Imperial College London where I gained a background in Biochemistry and Structural Biology. Whilst there, I developed novel Geometric Deep Learning methods for protein structure under the supervision of Prof Michael Bronstein.
